% This is the install script for the PhD face recognition toolbox. 
% 
% All this script does is 
% adding the toolbox paths to Matlabs search path. It should be noted that all 
% components of the toolbox were tested with Matlab version 7.11.0.584 
% (R2010b) running on Windows 7. Some parts were also tested with older 
% versions of Matlab. 
% 
% I have not tested any of the code on a Linux machine. Nevertheless, I see 
% no reason why it should not work on Linux as well. If this script fails you 
% probably do not have the necessary permissions to add the toolbox paths 
% to Matlabs "pathdef.m" file. Log in as an administrator and try again.
