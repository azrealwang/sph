% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function plots the so-called ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)
% curve and returns a hanle to the plotted graph. 
% 
% The function takes four input arguments, where the first two represent 
% the data to be plotted. More specifically, the first argument represents 
% a vector of verification rates and the second argument represents a vector 
% of corresponding miss rates. Both arguments can be calculated 
% from the matching scores using the "produce_ROC_PhD" function from the
% PhD face recognition toolbox. The third and frouth argument of the function 
% are optional and stand for the color of the plotted graph and the thickness 
% of the plotted graph. 
% 
% It should be noted that it is possible to add several graphs to the same
% figure using this function. In this regard, its usage is more or less 
% identical to Matlabs build-in "plot" function. 
% 
% Note that the function plots the verification rate against the miss
% rate. If you would like to plot the common false accaptance against the
% false rejection rate, use the function as shown in Example 2 above. All
% grpahs here are ploted in the "semilogx" scale. To change this according 
% to your preferences, you have to change the corresponding line of code in 
% the functions body.  
%

% REFERENCES
% There are several references available in the literature that describe 
% ROC curves and ways to plot them. A short description is alsgo given in:

% INPUTS:
% ver_rate              - a 1xN (or Nx1) vector of verification rates 
%                         obtained through the use of the "produce_ROC_PhD" 
%                         function or some of your own scripts/functions; 
%                         where N is the number of sampled points between 
%                         the smalest and largest matching score of your 
%                         experiments; the verification rate stands for 
%                         1-FRR, where FRR is the false rejection rate 
%                         (obligatory argument)
% miss_rate             - a 1xN (or Nx1) vector of miss rates (or false 
%                         acceptance rates) obtained through the use of the 
%                         "produce_ROC_PhD" function or some of your own 
%                         scripts/functions; where N is the number of 
%                         sampled points between the smalest and largest 
%                         matching score of your experiments; the 
%                         miss rate stands for FAR, where FAR is 
%                         the false rejection rate (obligatory argument)
% color                 - an argument determining the color of the plotted
%                         graph; see the help section of the "plot"
%                         function for details on this argument; e.g., 'r'
%                         (optional argument)
% thickness             - a parameter determinig the thickness of the
%                         plotted graph (optinal argument)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% h                     - the handle to the plotted graph 
%                         
%
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The function was tested with Matlab ver. 7.9.0.529 (R2009b) and Matlab 
% ver. 7.11.0.584 (R2010b).
