% The function plots the so-called CMC curve based on the provided input data
% 
% PROTOTYPE
% h=plot_CMC_PhD(rec_rates, ranks, color, thickness)
% 
% USAGE EXAMPLE(S)
% 
%     Example 1:
%       % we generate the values for plotting ourselves
%       ranks       = 1:10;
%       rec_rates   = [0.6 0.7 0.75 0.78 0.8 0.83 0.87 0.95 0.99 1];
%       h=plot_CMC_PhD(rec_rates, ranks);
%       axis([1 10 0 1])
% 
% 
% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function plots the so-called CMC (Cumulative Match Score Characteristic)
% curve and returns a hanle to the plotted graph. 
% 
% The function takes four input arguments, where the first two represent 
% the data to be plotted. More specifically, the first argument represents 
% a vector of recognition rates and the second argument represents a vector 
% of corresponding ranks. Both arguments can be calculated 
% from the matching scores using the "produce_CMC_PhD" function from the
% PhD face recognition toolbox. The third and frouth argument of the function 
% are optional and stand for the color of the plotted graph and the thickness 
% of the plotted graph. 
% 
% It should be noted that it is possible to add several graphs to the same
% figure using this function. In this regard, its usage is more or less 
% identical to Matlabs build-in "plot" function. 
%

% CMC curves are regulary used when assessing identification systems. Some
% information on CMC curves can be found in:

% INPUTS:
% rec_rates             - a 1xN vector of recognition rates obtained 
%                         through the use of the "produce_CMC_PhD" 
%                         function or some of your own scripts/functions; 
%                         where N is the number of ranks at which the 
%                         recognition rates were computed;(obligatory argument)
% ranks                 - a 1xN vector of ranks obtained through 
%                         the use of the "produce_CMC_PhD" function or some 
%                         of your own scripts/functions; where N is the 
%                         number of ranks at which the recognition rates 
%                         were computed;(obligatory argument)
% color                 - an argument determining the color of the plotted
%                         graph; see the help section of the "plot"
%                         function for details on this argument; e.g., 'r'
%                         (optional argument)
% thickness             - a parameter determinig the thickness of the
%                         plotted graph (optinal argument)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% h                     - the handle to the plotted graph 
%                         
%
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% Note that the CMC curve is plotted in the "semilogx" scale. To change 
% this setting and adjust it according to your preferences, uncomment the 
% coresponding line in the soure code and remove the currently active line.  
% 
% The function was tested with Matlab ver. 7.9.0.529 (R2009b) and Matlab 
% ver. 7.11.0.584 (R2010b).
