% A demo script showing how to use Gabor features, KFA and a phototmetric normalization technique from the INFace toolbox for face recognition
% 
% DEMO NAME: INFACE GABOR KFA FACE RECOGNITION AND EVALUATION DEMO
% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The script demonstrates how to use Gabor magnitude features, KFA and a 
% phototmetric normalization technique from the INFace toolbox for 
% illumination invariant face recognition on 
% real image data and how to classify face images based on Gabor magnitude 
% features and KFA and the nearest neighbor classifier. For matching score 
% calculation the 'mahcos' distance is used. After computing the similarity
% matrix the results are evaluated and some graphical and numerical results 
% are shown. For photometric normalization we use the Tan and Triggs 
% normalization scheme. 
% 
% Note that this demo uses a different partitioning of the input data when
% compared to the KFA_face_recognition_and_evaluation_demo. Here, we
% partition the data into three sets, where the first represents the 
% training data, the second represents the evaluation data (where hyper 
% parameters such as decision threshold are set) and the third set 
% represents the actual test data. This setting makes it possible to create 
% EPC cruves that were not created in the KFA_face_recognition_and_evaluation_demo.
% As a consequence you cannot compare the results directly, but have to
% implement the same partitioning scheme for the GAB+KFA features yourself.
% 
% The script shows how to use the functions from the toolbox to create an
% almost complete face recognition system (the face detection and 
% preprocessing steps are missing) and how to generate performance
% metrics.
% 
% For a more detailed description of the demo please have a look at the user
% manual.
% 
% Abbriviation of the system: INFACE+GAB+KFA+MAHCOS
% 
% The demo assumes that you have downloaded the ORL database and have
% unpacked it to the /demos/database folder. This folder should now have
% the following internal structure:
% 
%   /demos/database/ --- s1/
%                    |-- s2/
%                    |-- s3/
%                    |-- s4/
%                    |-- s5/
%                    |-- s6/
%                    ...
%                    |-- s40/
% 
% Each of the 40 subfolders should contain 10 images in PGM format. If you
% have not downloaded and unpacked the ORL database at all or have unpacked
% it into a different folder this demo will not work!!!
% 
% Please follow the install instructions in the install script.
% 
% IMPORTANT!!!!
% Note that you must run all demo scipts in this toolbox from the demos
% folder. This is particularly important, since some data needed by the
% scripts is located in folders whose paths are specified relative to the 
% demos folder. If you run the scripts from anywhere else, the scripts may
% fail.
% 
% 
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The script was tested with Matlab version 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) running 
% on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS.
