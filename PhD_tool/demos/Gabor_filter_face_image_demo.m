% A demo script showing how to filter an input face image with a bank of Gabor filters
% 
% DEMO NAME: GABOR FILTER FACE IMAGE DEMO
% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The script demonstrates how to filter an input image of size 128x128 pixels
% with a fitler bank of 40 Gabor filters. The demo constructs the filter
% bank, the filter the image with all filter from the bank and finally
% displays the result of the filtering in an Matlab figure. The entire
% process is repreated two times with different downscaling factors.
% 
% 
% IMPORTANT!!!!
% Note that you must run all demo scipts in this toolbox from the demos
% folder. This is particularly important, since some data needed by the
% scripts is located in folders whose paths are specified relative to the 
% demos folder. If you run the scripts from anywhere else, the scripts may
% fail.
% 
% 
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The script was tested with Matlab version 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) running 
% on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS.

% OTHER TOOLBOXES 
% If you are interested in face recognition you are invited too have a look
% at the INface toolbox as well. It contains implementations of several
% state-of-the-art photometric normalization techniques that can further 
% improve the face recognition performance, especcially in difficult 
% illumination conditions. The toolbox is available from:
