% A demo script showing how to compute a KFA subspace
% 
% DEMO NAME: PERFORM KFA DEMO
% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The script demonstrates how to compute a KFA subspace from actual image
% data. The demo assumes that you have downloaded the ORL database and have
% unpacked it to the /demos/database folder. This folder should now have
% the following internal structure:
% 
%   /demos/database/ --- s1/
%                    |-- s2/
%                    |-- s3/
%                    |-- s4/
%                    |-- s5/
%                    |-- s6/
%                    ...
%                    |-- s40/
% 
% Each of the 40 subfolders should contain 10 images in PGM format. If you
% have not downloaded and unpacked the ORL database at all or have unpacked
% it into a different folder this demo will not work!!!
% 
% Please follow the install instructions in the install script.
% 
% 
% IMPORTANT!!!!
% Note that you must run all demo scipts in this toolbox from the demos
% folder. This is particularly important, since some data needed by the
% scripts is located in folders whose paths are specified relative to the 
% demos folder. If you run the scripts from anywhere else, the scripts may
% fail.
% 
% 
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The script was tested with Matlab version 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) running 
% on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS.

% Official website:
% If you have down-loaded the toolbox from any other location than the

% 
% OTHER TOOLBOXES 
% If you are interested in face recognition you are invited too have a look
% at the INface toolbox as well. It contains implementations of several
% state-of-the-art photometric normalization techniques that can further 
% improve the face recognition performance, especcially in difficult 
% illumination conditions. The toolbox is available from:
