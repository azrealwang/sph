% A demo script showing how to use a function from the toolbox to register the face based on manually anotated eye coordinates. 
% 
% DEMO NAME: FACE REGISTRATION DEMO
% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The script uses the "register_face_based_on_eyes" function from the PhD
% toolbox to demonstrate how to register the face based in manually
% enotated eye coordinates. Specifically, it demonstrates two different 
% examples. In the first the coordinates are hard coded in the script and
% in the second they are read from an external file. For more inormation on
% the "register_face_based_on_eyes" and its functionality, please type
% 
% help register_face_based_on_eyes
%
% into Matlab's command window.
% 
% 
% IMPORTANT!!!!
% Note that you must run all demo scipts in this toolbox from the demos
% folder. This is particularly important, since some data needed by the
% scripts is located in folders whose paths are specified relative to the 
% demos folder. If you run the scripts from anywhere else, the scripts may
% fail.
% 
% 
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The script was tested with Matlab version 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) running 
% on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS.

% OTHER TOOLBOXES 
% If you are interested in face recognition you are invited too have a look
% at the INface toolbox as well. It contains implementations of several
% state-of-the-art photometric normalization techniques that can further 
% improve the face recognition performance, especcially in difficult 
% illumination conditions. The toolbox is available from:
