% A demo script showing how to use PCA for face recognition and how to evaluate the results
% 
% DEMO NAME: PCA FACE RECOGNITION AND EVALUATION DEMO
% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The script demonstrates how to use PCA on real image data and how to
% classify face images based on PCA and the nearest neighbor classifier.
% For matching score calculation the 'mahcos' distance is used. After
% computing the similarity matrix the results are evaluated and some
% graphical and numercal results are shown.
% 
% The script shows how to use the functions from the toolbox to create an
% almost complete face recognition system (the face detection and 
% preprocessing steps are missing) and how to generate performance
% metrics.
% 
% For a more detailed description of the demo pleasehave a look at the user
% manual.
% 
% Abbriviation of the system: PCA+MAHCOS
% 
% The demo assumes that you have downloaded the ORL database and have
% unpacked it to the /demos/database folder. This folder should now have
% the following internal structure:
% 
%   /demos/database/ --- s1/
%                    |-- s2/
%                    |-- s3/
%                    |-- s4/
%                    |-- s5/
%                    |-- s6/
%                    ...
%                    |-- s40/
% 
% Each of the 40 subfolders should contain 10 images in PGM format. If you
% have not downloaded and unpacked the ORL database at all or have unpacked
% it into a different folder this demo will not work!!!
% 
% Please follow the install instructions in the install script.
% 
% IMPORTANT!!!!
% Note that you must run all demo scipts in this toolbox from the demos
% folder. This is particularly important, since some data needed by the
% scripts is located in folders whose paths are specified relative to the 
% demos folder. If you run the scripts from anywhere else, the scripts may
% fail.
% 
% 
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The script was tested with Matlab version 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) running 
% on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS.
