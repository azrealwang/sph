% A demo script showing how to construct a filter bank of Gabor filters and to display the real/imaginary parts and magnitudes od the filters. 
% 
% DEMO NAME: CONSTRUCT GABORS AND DISPLAY BANK DEMO
% 
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The script uses the "construct_Gabor_filters_PhD" function from the PhD
% toolbox to demonstrate how to construct a bank of Gabor filters for facial 
% feature extraction. The script construct the default filter bank of 40 filters 
% with 8 orientations and 5 scales, with the filter parameters selected for
% optimal performance with 128x128 pixel face images. Note that for other 
% face image sizes other filter parameters may deliver better results.  
% 
% 
% IMPORTANT!!!!
% Note that you must run all demo scipts in this toolbox from the demos
% folder. This is particularly important, since some data needed by the
% scripts is located in folders whose paths are specified relative to the 
% demos folder. If you run the scripts from anywhere else, the scripts may
% fail.
% 
% 
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The script was tested with Matlab version 7.11.0.584 (R2010b) running 
% on a 64-bit Windows 7 OS.

% OTHER TOOLBOXES 
% If you are interested in face recognition you are invited too have a look
% at the INface toolbox as well. It contains implementations of several
% state-of-the-art photometric normalization techniques that can further 
% improve the face recognition performance, especcially in difficult 
% illumination conditions. The toolbox is available from:
