% USAGE EXAMPLE(S)
% 
%     Example 1:
%       %we randomly initialize the model with all of its fields; in
%       %practice this would be done using one of the appropriate functions
%       %from the RELATED_FUNCTIONS section
%       X = double(imread('sample_face.bmp'));
%       model.P = randn(length(X(:)),1);    %random 10 dimensional model
%       model.dim = 10;
%       model.W = randn(length(X(:)),10);
%       feat = linear_subspace_projection_PhD(X(:), model, 0);

% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function computes the features (or subspace projection coefficients)
% for linear subspace projection techniques (or subspace methods), such as
% PCA, LDA, ICA and others, given a model containing the parameters of the 
% subspace method. Note that this function does not compute the transforms 
% (i.e., the subspaces, transformation matrices, etc.), it only uses a 
% precomputed model to calculate the subspace projection.
% 
% Here, the input data in X has to be arranged into a column data matrix.
% This means that if the test-data matrix X is of size BxA, then there are
% A test samples (images) each having B variables (pixels). While the
% case where the X is transposed is handeled automatically (an input test-data
% matrix of size AxB), it is necessary that the dimensionality of the test 
% data matches that of the training data - the images in vector form need 
% to have the same number of pixels.
% 
% The input data can be a single image (in vector) form, in which case the
% the output "feat" contains the feature vector corresponding to the input 
% test sample X, or it can be a data matrix, in which case the output "feat" 
% is also a matrix, containing in its columns the feature vectors 
% corresponding to the test samples in X. 
%
% To see an example of usage of the function look at the demo folder.
%
% 
% REFERENCES
% The function implements a simple projection of the test data into a
% low-dimensioanl subspace, which is documented in a lot of references, see
% for example:

% INPUTS:
% X                     - test-data matrix of size BxA, where each of
%                         the columns contains A samples, each having a
%                         dimensionality of B
% model                 - the subspace model generated using the
%                         appropriate function (see the RELATED FUNCTIONS 
%                         part of this help)
% orthogon              - a parameter defining whether the subspace basis is
%                         orthogonal or not; if you are not sure select the
%                         non-orthogonal option, the result is the same,
%                         however, the computation is slower
%                         orthogon ... 1 - is orthogonal (e.g., PCA ,LDA)
%                                  ... 0 - is not orthogonal (e.g., ICA1, ICA2)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% feat                  - a vector or matrix (depending on the input)
%                         containing the subspace features of the input 
%                         test samples 
%
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The dimensionality of the feature vectors produced here is defined by the
% dimensionality of the transformation matrix in "model.W". I have not
% included an option so far to reduce the dimensionality of the feature 
% vectors at this point. I will do that in the classification stage. 
%
% The function was tested with Matlab ver. 7.9.0.529 (R2009b) and Matlab 
% ver. 7.11.0.584 (R2010b).
