%
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function computes the PCA subspace based on the training data X.
% Here, the data has to be arranged into the columns of the input training
% data matrix X. This means that if you have A inputs (input images in 
% vector form) and each of these inputs has B elements (e.g., pixels), then
% the training-data matrix has to be of size BxA. The second input
% parameter n determines the number of the retained PCA components. Note 
% that n mustn't exceed the rank of the training data matrix X. As it
% stands now, the function is implemented to check only for the theoretical
% rank of the matrix, i.e., n = min([A,B])-1, and not the actual rank of
% the matrix. This is done for reasons of speed, as I am working with rather
% high-dimensional data (128x128 pixel images - a lot of them). If you have
% multiple copies of the same data-sample (i.e., image) in your training
% data or you suspect that the input data is highly correlated be sure to 
% set n properly. Otherwise, you will end up with a subspace, where a few 
% of the basis vectors correspond to zero-valued eigenvalues.
% 
% The function does not perform any normalization of input data, it just
% computes the PCA subspace. If you would like to perform data
% normalization (e.g., remove illumination variations) have a look at the
% INFace toolbox.

% Neurosicence, Vol. 3, No. 1, 1991, pp. 71-86.

%
% INPUTS:
% X                     - training-data matrix of size BxA, where each of
%                         the A columns contains one sample - each sample 
%                         having a dimensionality of B (obligatory
%                         argument)
% n                     - a parameter determining the number of PCA 
%                         eigenvectors to retain in the PCA model; if the 
%                         parameter is omitted when calling the function, a 
%                         default value of n = min([A,B])-1 is used.
%
% OUTPUTS:
% model                 - a structure containing the PCA subspace parameters 
%                         needed to project a given test sample into the 
%                         PCA subspace, the model has the following 
%                         structure:
% 
%                         model.P     . . . the mean face in vector form
%                         model.dim   . . . the dimensionality of the
%                                           PCA subspace
%                         model.W     . . . the tranformation matrix (the eigenfaces)
%                         model.train . . . PCA fetures corresponding to
%                                           the training data 
%

% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The function is implemented to produce the PCA subspace without using any
% for loops. Therefore, the function may not succeed if you have a realy,
% realy big input training-data matrix (a lot of samples and high-dimensional 
% images). You can (partialy) overcome this by reducing the size of the
% training images or adding a for loop in the centering step and the
% covariance matrix computation. If you have enough memory it should work
% fine. The function was tested on PC with a 3.2 GHz Intel Duo core 
% processor and 3GB of RAM. For a training data matrix with more than 2000
% images and an image size of 128x128 pixels there were no problems.
%
% The function was tested with Matlab ver. 7.9.0.529 (R2009b) and Matlab 
% ver. 7.11.0.584 (R2010b).
