% PROTOTYPE
% model = perform_lda_PhD(X,ids,n)
% 
% USAGE EXAMPLE(S)
% 
%     Example 1:
%       %In this example we generate the training data randomly and also 
%       %generate the class labels manualy; for a detailed example have a 
%       %look at the LDA demo
%       X = randn(300,100); %generate 100 samples with a dimension of 300
%       ids = repmat(1:25,1,4); %generate 25-class id vector
%       model = perform_lda_PhD(X,ids,24); %generate LDA model
%
%
% GENERAL DESCRIPTION
% The function computes the LDA subspace based on the training data X.
% Here, the data has to be arranged into the columns of the input training
% data matrix X. This means that if you have A inputs (input images in 
% vector form) and each of these inputs has B elements (e.g., pixels), then
% the training-data matrix has to be of size BxA. The second input
% parameter "ids" represents a vector of class labels, where the class
% labels take numeric values. For example, if the first three images in X 
% would belong to the first subject and second three images would belong to 
% the second subject, and there would be 6 images in total in the matrix X, 
% then the input parameter would take the following form: ind = [1 1 1 2 2
% 2]. In any case, the length of the parameter "ids" has to fit the nummber
% of samples in X. The third input parameter n determines the number of the 
% retained LDA components. Note that n mustn't exceed the number of classes 
% minus one, which equals the rank of the between class scatter matrix. 
% 
% It should be noted that this function is not an implementation of the
% linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm, as it does not operate on 
% the actual data. This function is an implementation of the Fisherface 
% algorithm which applies LDA in the PCA subspace to aviod singularity 
% issues. It is intended and was also only tested for cases where the 
% number of samples is smaller than the dimensionality of the samples. If 
% you require a function working properly in other situations please use a 
% different toolbox. 
% 
% The function does not perform any normalization of the input data, it just
% computes the LDA (or better said the Fisherface) subspace. If you would like 
% to perform data normalization (e.g., remove illumination variations) have 
% a look at the INFace toolbox.

% INPUTS:
% X                     - training-data matrix of size BxA, where each of
%                         the A columns contains one sample - each sample 
%                         having a dimensionality of B (obligatory argument)
% ids                   - a vector of size 1xA, where each numeric value in
%                         "ids" encodes the class-label of the corresponding
%                         sample in X (obligatory argument)
% n                     - a parameter determining the number of LDA 
%                         basis vectors to retain in the LDA model; if the 
%                         parameter is omitted when calling the function, a 
%                         default value of n = number_of_classes-1 is used.
%                         (optional argument)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% model                 - a structure containing the LDA subspace parameters 
%                         needed to project a given test sample into the 
%                         LDA subspace, the model has the following 
%                         structure:
% 
%                         model.P     . . . the mean face in vector form
%                         model.dim   . . . the dimensionality of the
%                                           LDA subspace
%                         model.W     . . . the tranformation matrix (the eigenfaces)
%                         model.train . . . LDA fetures corresponding to
%                                           the training data 
%                         
%
% NOTES / COMMENTS
% The function is implemented to produce the LDA subspace using as few for 
% loops as possible. Therefore, the function may not succeed if you have a realy,
% realy big input training-data matrix (a lot of samples and high-dimensional 
% images). You can (partialy) overcome this by reducing the size of the
% training images or adding for loops when computing the scatter matrices - 
% this is indicated in the code for the Fib case.
%
% The function was tested with Matlab ver. 7.9.0.529 (R2009b) and Matlab 
% ver. 7.11.0.584 (R2010b).
